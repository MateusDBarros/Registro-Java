# CRUD Application with PostgreSQL Integration

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built as part of my learning journey in backend development. The application integrates with a **PostgreSQL** database to handle persistent data storage and retrieval. It focuses on applying solid development principles, organizing backend logic, and ensuring smooth integration with a relational database.

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Database Modeling**: Structured database design with normalized tables and relationships.  
- **CRUD Operations**: Fully functional endpoints to create, read, update, and delete records.  
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Backend connected to PostgreSQL for seamless data management.  
- **Code Quality**: Organized codebase following best practices such as separation of concerns and clear structure.  
- **Logging and Debugging**: Added logs for easier error tracking and debugging.
